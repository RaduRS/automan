TRANSCRIPTS:
${combinedTranscripts}

ORIGINAL WORD COUNT: ${originalWordCount} words
TARGET SCRIPT LENGTH: 150-200 words maximum (optimized for 40-60 second videos)

TARGET AUDIENCE: Ambitious men aged 20-40 seeking discipline, self-improvement, and peak performance. They struggle with consistency and want practical strategies, not just motivational fluff.

CONTENT FOCUS: Motivational Content & Discipline Transformation, Daily discipline strategies, Success scenarios, Men's self-improvement, Ancient wisdom for modern challenges.

CRITICAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- PRESERVE the conversational, authentic voice from the original transcripts
- Keep the natural flow and rhythm - don't make it sound scripted
- Use the SAME energy level as the original content
- Maintain any slang, casual language, or personality quirks that make it authentic
- Sound like someone talking to a friend, not giving a corporate presentation

BANNED PHRASES & WORDS (DO NOT USE):
- "The brutal truth is..."
- "Unleash", "Dominate", "Conquer", "Destroy", "Elevate"  
- "Transform your mindset"
- "Ancient wisdom"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "It's time to..." (unless naturally occurring in original)
- Generic hustle culture buzzwords
- Corporate motivational speak

SCRIPT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. AUTHENTIC HOOK (First 3-5 seconds): Use natural, conversational opening that feels real - questions, observations, or relatable statements
2. KEEP IT REAL: Maintain the speaking style and energy of the original content
3. PRACTICAL INSIGHT: Give actionable advice in natural language
4. RELATABLE CONCLUSION: End with something that feels genuine, not forced
5. NATURAL CALL TO ACTION: If included, make it feel organic to the conversation

HOOK VARIETY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - CHOOSE DIVERSE OPENINGS):
- AVOID predictable patterns like always starting with "Ever notice"
- SELECT opening styles that best match the content and audience
- PRIORITIZE fresh, unexpected hooks over formulaic ones
- CHOOSE from diverse opening approaches to keep content engaging

AUTHENTIC LANGUAGE PATTERNS (Select the most natural fit for this specific content):
- Direct questions: "You know what's crazy?" "Know what I realized?" "What if I told you..."
- Real observations: "Here's the thing..." "Look..." "I noticed something..."
- Personal insights: "I figured out..." "Here's what changed for me..." "Let me tell you something..."
- Conversational challenges: "Stop playing that game..." "Cut that out..." "Here's your problem..."
- Bold statements: "Most guys get this wrong..." "Nobody talks about this..." "This changed everything..."
- Relatable scenarios: "Picture this..." "You know that feeling when..." "We've all been there..."
- Natural transitions: "But here's the deal..." "The thing is..." "Here's what's wild..."

PRESERVE AUTHENTICITY:
- Keep any natural speech patterns from the original transcripts
- Don't over-polish the language - rough edges make it real
- Use contractions and casual language when appropriate
- Maintain the emotional tone and intensity of the original
- Let personality shine through instead of corporate polish

AVOID AT ALL COSTS:
- Template language that sounds like every other motivational post
- Buzzword-heavy sentences
- Overly formal or "professional" tone
- Generic self-help speak
- Anything that doesn't sound like natural conversation
- OVERUSED OPENING PATTERNS (especially defaulting to "Ever notice")
- Predictable or formulaic hooks that sound like templates
- Generic openings that could apply to any motivational content

DESCRIPTION & HASHTAG REQUIREMENTS:
- Description: 1-2 sentences max, conversational tone with relevant emojis
- Hashtags: Mix of 3-5 UNIQUE tags combining broad appeal (#Motivation) with specific niche. Avoid overused tags like #GrindSeason
- Keep it authentic, not corporate

{
  "script": "Transform the content while preserving the authentic conversational voice and natural energy. Keep it real, relatable, and true to the original speaking style. 150-200 words maximum...",
  "title": "Authentic, attention-grabbing title that sounds like real conversation, not corporate speak...",
  "description": "Natural, conversational description with emojis that complements the authentic script...",
